# CS6910-Fundamentals-of-Deeplearning
This repository contains the solutions to all the assignments that were done as part of enhancing the learning experience in the CS6910: Fundamentals of Deep Learning course offered by Indian Institute of Technology Madras. The course was taught by Prof. Mitesh Khapra.

In the first assignment we create a neural network model and implement the variants of gradient descent from scratch.
In the second assignment we train a CNN model from scratch.
In the third assingment we create a transliteration system using RNN
